# In Hoffa's Shadow 

Side notes: 
- This is first book that I have the author's signature.
- The second day the author gave us the talk, the book's heroine, the author's father passed away. 
In the talk the author said he was planning to see his father next week. That's just life. Cherish 
everyone and everyday. 

Hoffa's success had little to do with the legalisms of the Wagner Act, for which he had little 
patience or need, or the birth of the CIO, with which he would often clash. It was attributable, 
rather, to skills and tactics for which he would later become famous - convincing personal pitches
to the rank and file, intimate knowledge of trucking economics, dictatiorail centralization of 
collective bargaining, relentless expansion of the bargaining unit, and a preternatural talent
for negotiation. But more than anything else in the 1930s, Hoffa succeeded because he learned to 
deploy voilent force successfully.
