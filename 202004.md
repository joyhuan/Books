## Learning Process 
The game is to keep learning. You gotta like the learning process. 

If you're going to be an investor, you're going to make some investments 
where you don't have all the experience you need. 

The keys are discipline, hard work, and practice. It's like playing golf - 
you have to work on it. 

If you don't keep learning, other people will pass you by. 

## Circle of Competence and Its Boundaries 
There are a lot of things we pass on. We have three baskets: in, out, and 
too tough. We have to have a special insight, or we'll put it in the "too
tough" basket. All you have to look for is a special area of competency and 
focus on that. 

If you have competence, you know the edge. It wouldn't be a competence if you 
didn't know where the boundaries lie. [Asking whether you've passed the boundary
is] a question that almost answers itself. 

## Cost of Capital and Opportunity Costs

## Unrealistic Assumptions 
"Abraham Lincoln once asked: 'How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail 
a leg? Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.' Likewise, just because
an actuary says you can earn 9% on pension-plan assets, it doesn't magically 
alter the reality of your future liability."

??? What does this mean? 

"A man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way."
-- Mark Twain

It is the nature of many forms of derivatives, and insurance as well, to have "long
tails" of exposure. Years can elapse before an actual day of reckoning occurs with 
respect to loss or gain on an individual transaction. Insurers or financial 
institutions that incorrectly assess their true exposure often experience the kind of
painful lesson Twain refers to above. 

## Mental Models
**The Importance of Multiple Mental Models**
You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely -- all of them,
not just a few. You know the old saying: To the man with a hammer, the world looks like
a nail. 

## The Ethos of Not Fooling Yourself
**Common (and Uncommon) Sense**
Organized common (or uncommon) sense -- very basic knowledge -- is an enormously powerful
tool. There are huge dangers with computers. People calculate too much and think too little. 

Part of [having uncommon sense] is being able to tune out folly, as opposed to recognize 
wisdom. 

Henry E. Singleton (1916-1999) **Business and Chess Master**

## Critique of Academia 
**Fatal Unconnectedness**: There's a lot wrong [with American universities]. I'd remove 
three-fourths of the faculty -- everything but the hard sciences. But nobody's going
to do that, so we'll have to live with the defects. 

I think liberal arts faculties at major universities have views that are not very sound,
at least on public policy issues. [However,] they may know a lot of French. 

## Tips on How to Be Happy and Successful
A log of success in life and business comes from knowing what you want to avoid: early
death, a bad marriage, etc. 

Just avoid things like AIDS situations, racing trains to the crossing, and doing cocaine. 
Develop good mental habits.

Avoid evil, particularly if they're attractive members of the opposite sex.

If your new behavior earns you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group, then
the hell with them. 

## Humor ???? Eludes me haha 
- I always like it when someone attractive to me agrees with me, so I have fond memories of 
Phil Fisher. 
- It is, of course, normal for self-appraisal to be more positive than external appraisal. 
Indeed, a problem of this sort may have given you your speaker today. 
- It's been so long since we've bought anything that [asking us about our market impact when 
we're trading] is like asking Rip Van Winkle about the past twenty years. 
- I think the people who are attracted to be prison guard are not nature's noblemen to begin
with. 
- Ben Franklin was a very good ambassador; and whatever was wrong with him from John Adams' 
point of view [I'm sure] helped him with the French. 

## Talk One: Harvard School Commencement Speech June 13, 1986
### Carson's prescription for sure misery included:
1. Ingesting chemicals in an effort to alter mood or perception; 

2. Envy; and 

3. Resentment 

### Four more prescriptions from Munger: 
1. Be unreliable 

2. Learn everything you possibly can from your own experience, minimizing what you learn vicariously from the good and bad experience of others, living and dead. 

3. Go down and stay down when you get your first, second, or third severe reverse in the battle of life. 

4. Ignore a story they told me when I was very young about a rustic who said, "I wish I knew where I was going to die, and then I'd never go there."

- The life of Darwin demonstrates how a turtle may outrun the hares, aided by extreme objectivity, which helps the objective person end up like the only player without a blindfold in a game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey. 

## Talk Two: A Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom as It Relates to Investment Management and Business 
#### The University of Southern California Marshall School of Business, April 14, 1994

- If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form.

- You've got to have models in your head. And you've got to array your experience - both vicarious and direct - on this latticework of models. 

- The Fermat/Pascal system is dramatically consonant with the way that the world works. And it's fundamental truth. So you simply have to have the technique. 

- But you have to know enough about it to understand its limitations - because although accounting is the starting place, it's only a crude approximation. 

- His rule for all the Braun Company's communications was called the five Ws - you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when, and why. ... Well, again, that's a rule of psychology. If you always tell people why, they'll understand it better, they'll consider it more important, and they'll be more likely to comply. 

- Which models are the most reliable? Well, obviously, the models that come from hard science and engineering are the most reliable models on this Earth. And engineering quality control - at least the guts of it that matters to you and me and people who are not professional engineers - is very much based on the elementary mathematics of Fermat and Pascal. 

- And, of course, the engineering idea of a backup system is a very powerful idea. The engineering idea of breakpoints - that's a very powerful model, too. The notion of a critical mass - that comes out of physics, is a very powerful model.

- All of these things have great utility in looking at ordinary reality. And all of this cost-benefit analysis - hell, that's all elementary high school algebra. It's just been dolled up a little bit with fancy lingo.

- I suppose the next most reliable models are from biology/physiology because, after all, all of us are programmed by our genetic makeup to be much the same. 

- (psychology is very much more complicated but ungodly important if you're going to have any worldly wisdom) And the reason why is that the perceptual apparatus of man has shortcuts in it. The brain cannot have unlimited circuitry. So someone who knows how to take advantage of those shortcuts and cause the brain to miscalculate in certain ways can cause you to see things that aren't there. 

- Now you get into the cognitive function as distinguished from the perceptual function. And there, you are equally - more than equally in fact - likely to be misled. 

- So when circumstances combine in certain ways - or more commonly, your fellow man starts acting like the magician and manipulates you on purpose by causing you cognitive dysfunction - you're a patsy. 

- The elementary part of psychology - the psychology of misjudgment, as I call it - is a terribly important thing to learn. There are about twenty little principles. And they interact, so it gets slightly complicated. But the guts of it is unbelievably important. 

- There's another saying that comes from Pascal that I've always considered one of the really accurate observations in the history of thought. Pascal said, "The mind of man at one and the same time is both the glory and the shame of the universe."

- Personally, I've gotton so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically doing these things- which, by and large, are useful but which often misfunction?

- One approach is rationality – the way you’d work out a bridge problem: by evaluating the real interests, the real probabilities, and so forth. And the other is evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious conclusions – many of which are wrong.  

- Now we come to another somewhat less reliable form of human wisdom – microeconomics. And here, I find it quite useful to think of a free market economy – or partly free market economy – as soft of the equivalent of an ecosystem. 

- Just as in an ecosystem, people who narrowly specialize can get terribly good at occupying some little niche. just as animals flourish in niches, similarly, people who specialize in the business world – and get very good because they specialize – frequently find good economics that they wouldn’t get any other way. 

- And once we get into microeconomics, we get into the concept of advantages of scale. Now we’re getting closer to investment analysis – because in terms of which business succeed and which businesses fail, advantages of scale are ungodly important. 

- For example, one great advantage of scale taught in all of the business schools of the world is cost reductions along the so-called experience curve. Just doing something complicated in more and more volume enables human beings, who are trying to improve and are motivated by the incentives of capitalism, to do it more and more efficiently.

- The very nature of things is that if you get a whole lot of volume through your operation, you get better at processing that volume. That’s an enormous advantage. And it has a lot to do with which businesses succeed and fail.

- Let’s go through a list – albeit an incomplete one – of possible advantages of scale. Some come from simple geometry. If you’re building a great circular tank, obviously, as you build it bigger, the amount of steel you use in the surface goes up with the square and the cubic volume goes up with the cube. So as you increase the dimensions, you can hold a lot more volume per unit area of steel. 

- And there are all kinds of things like that where the simple geometry – the simple reality – gives you an advantage of scale. 

- For example, you can get advantages of scale from TV advertising. … In effect, if you didn’t have a big volumne, you couldn’t use network TV advertising – which was the most effective technique. … So when TV came in, the branded companies that were already big got a huge tailwind. Indeed, they prospered and prospered and prospered until some of them got fat and foolish, which happens with prosperity – at least to some people. 

- And you advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. So, in effect, Wrigley, simply by being so well known, has advantages of scale – what you might call an informational advantage. 

- Another advantage of scale comes from psychology. The psychologists use the term “social proof.” We are all influenced – subconsciously and, to some extent, consciously – by what we see others do and approve.

- Side1: “Change, as in the case of the Internet, can be the friend of society. But it is the absence of change that is often the friend of the investor." -- Buffett

- Side2: “Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others.” – Jack Welch

- Side3: “What you measure is what you get. What you reward is what you get.” – Welch  

- Similarly, all these huge advantages of scale allow greater specialization within the firm. Therefore, each person can be better at what he does.
