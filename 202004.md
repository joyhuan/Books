# Poor Charlies's Almanack 

## Learning Process 
The game is to keep learning. You gotta like the learning process. 

If you're going to be an investor, you're going to make some investments 
where you don't have all the expreience you need. 

The keys are discipline, hard work, and practice. It's like playing golf - 
you have to work on it. 

If you don't keep learning, other people will pass you by. 

## Circle of Competence and Its Boundaries 
There are a lot of things we pass on. We have three baskets: in, out, and 
too tough. We have to have a special insight, or we'll put it in the "too
tough" basket. All you have to look for is a special area of competency and 
focus on that. 

If you have competence, you know the edge. It wouldn't be a competence if you 
didn't know where the boundaries lie. [Asking whether you've passed the boundary
is] a question that almost answers itself. 

## Cost of Capital and Opportunity Costs

## Unrealistic Assumptions 
"Abraham Lincoln once asked: 'How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail 
a leg? Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.' Likewise, just because
an actuary says you can earn 9% on pension-plan assets, it doesn't magically 
alter the reality of your future liability."
