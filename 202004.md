## Learning Process 
The game is to keep learning. You gotta like the learning process. 

If you're going to be an investor, you're going to make some investments 
where you don't have all the experience you need. 

The keys are discipline, hard work, and practice. It's like playing golf - 
you have to work on it. 

If you don't keep learning, other people will pass you by. 

## Circle of Competence and Its Boundaries 
There are a lot of things we pass on. We have three baskets: in, out, and 
too tough. We have to have a special insight, or we'll put it in the "too
tough" basket. All you have to look for is a special area of competency and 
focus on that. 

If you have competence, you know the edge. It wouldn't be a competence if you 
didn't know where the boundaries lie. [Asking whether you've passed the boundary
is] a question that almost answers itself. 

## Cost of Capital and Opportunity Costs

## Unrealistic Assumptions 
"Abraham Lincoln once asked: 'How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail 
a leg? Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.' Likewise, just because
an actuary says you can earn 9% on pension-plan assets, it doesn't magically 
alter the reality of your future liability."

??? What does this mean? 

"A man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way."
-- Mark Twain

It is the nature of many forms of derivatives, and insurance as well, to have "long
tails" of exposure. Years can elapse before an actual day of reckoning occurs with 
respect to loss or gain on an individual transaction. Insurers or financial 
institutions that incorrectly assess their true exposure often experience the kind of
painful lesson Twain refers to above. 

## Mental Models
**The Importance of Multiple Mental Models**
You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely -- all of them,
not just a few. You know the old saying: To the man with a hammer, the world looks like
a nail. 

## The Ethos of Not Fooling Yourself
**Common (and Uncommon) Sense**
Organized common (or uncommon) sense -- very basic knowledge -- is an enormously powerful
tool. There are huge dangers with computers. People calculate too much and think too little. 

Part of [having uncommon sense] is being able to tune out folly, as opposed to recognize 
wisdom. 

Henry E. Singleton (1916-1999) **Business and Chess Master**

## Critique of Academia 
**Fatal Unconnectedness**: There's a lot wrong [with American universities]. I'd remove 
three-fourths of the faculty -- everything but the hard sciences. But nobody's going
to do that, so we'll have to live with the defects. 

I think liberal arts faculties at major universities have views that are not very sound,
at least on public policy issues. [However,] they may know a lot of French. 

## Tips on How to Be Happy and Successful
A log of success in life and business comes from knowing what you want to avoid: early
death, a bad marriage, etc. 

Just avoid things like AIDS situations, racing trains to the crossing, and doing cocaine. 
Develop good mental habits.

Avoid evil, particularly if they're attractive members of the opposite sex.

![Ulysses and the Sirens](https://github.com/joyhuan/Books/blob/master/Draper_Herbert_James_Ulysses_and_the_Sirens.jpg)

If your new behavior earns you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group, then
the hell with them. 

## Humor ???? Eludes me haha 
- I always like it when someone attractive to me agrees with me, so I have fond memories of 
Phil Fisher. 
- It is, of course, normal for self-appraisal to be more positive than external appraisal. 
Indeed, a problem of this sort may have given you your speaker today. 
- It's been so long since we've bought anything that [asking us about our market impact when 
we're trading] is like asking Rip Van Winkle about the past twenty years. 
- I think the people who are attracted to be prison guard are not nature's noblemen to begin
with. 
- Ben Franklin was a very good ambassador; and whatever was wrong with him from John Adams' 
point of view [I'm sure] helped him with the French. 

## Talk One: Harvard School Commencement Speech June 13, 1986
### Carson's prescription for sure misery included:
1. Ingesting chemicals in an effort to alter mood or perception; 

2. Envy; and 

3. Resentment 

### Four more prescriptions from Munger: 
1. Be unreliable 

2. Learn everything you possibly can from your own experience, minimizing what you learn vicariously from the good and bad experience of others, living and dead. 

3. Go down and stay down when you get your first, second, or third severe reverse in the battle of life. 

4. Ignore a story they told me when I was very young about a rustic who said, "I wish I knew where I was going to die, and then I'd never go there."

- The life of Darwin demonstrates how a turtle may outrun the hares, aided by extreme objectivity, which helps the objective person end up like the only player without a blindfold in a game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey. 

## Talk Two: A Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom as It Relates to Investment Management and Business 
#### The University of Southern California Marshall School of Business, April 14, 1994

- If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form.

- You've got to have models in your head. And you've got to array your experience - both vicarious and direct - on this latticework of models. 

- The Fermat/Pascal system is dramatically consonant with the way that the world works. And it's fundamental truth. So you simply have to have the technique. 

- But you have to know enough about it to understand its limitations - because although accounting is the starting place, it's only a crude approximation. 

- His rule for all the Braun Company's communications was called the five Ws - you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when, and why. ... Well, again, that's a rule of psychology. If you always tell people why, they'll understand it better, they'll consider it more important, and they'll be more likely to comply. 

- Which models are the most reliable? Well, obviously, the models that come from hard science and engineering are the most reliable models on this Earth. And engineering quality control - at least the guts of it that matters to you and me and people who are not professional engineers - is very much based on the elementary mathematics of Fermat and Pascal. 

- And, of course, the engineering idea of a backup system is a very powerful idea. The engineering idea of breakpoints - that's a very powerful model, too. The notion of a critical mass - that comes out of physics, is a very powerful model.

- All of these things have great utility in looking at ordinary reality. And all of this cost-benefit analysis - hell, that's all elementary high school algebra. It's just been dolled up a little bit with fancy lingo.

- I suppose the next most reliable models are from biology/physiology because, after all, all of us are programmed by our genetic makeup to be much the same. 

- (psychology is very much more complicated but ungodly important if you're going to have any worldly wisdom) And the reason why is that the perceptual apparatus of man has shortcuts in it. The brain cannot have unlimited circuitry. So someone who knows how to take advantage of those shortcuts and cause the brain to miscalculate in certain ways can cause you to see things that aren't there. 

- Now you get into the cognitive function as distinguished from the perceptual function. And there, you are equally - more than equally in fact - likely to be misled. 

- So when circumstances combine in certain ways - or more commonly, your fellow man starts acting like the magician and manipulates you on purpose by causing you cognitive dysfunction - you're a patsy. 

- The elementary part of psychology - the psychology of misjudgment, as I call it - is a terribly important thing to learn. There are about twenty little principles. And they interact, so it gets slightly complicated. But the guts of it is unbelievably important. 

- There's another saying that comes from Pascal that I've always considered one of the really accurate observations in the history of thought. Pascal said, "The mind of man at one and the same time is both the glory and the shame of the universe."

- Personally, I've gotton so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically doing these things- which, by and large, are useful but which often misfunction?

- One approach is rationality – the way you’d work out a bridge problem: by evaluating the real interests, the real probabilities, and so forth. And the other is evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious conclusions – many of which are wrong.  

- Now we come to another somewhat less reliable form of human wisdom – microeconomics. And here, I find it quite useful to think of a free market economy – or partly free market economy – as soft of the equivalent of an ecosystem. 

- Just as in an ecosystem, people who narrowly specialize can get terribly good at occupying some little niche. just as animals flourish in niches, similarly, people who specialize in the business world – and get very good because they specialize – frequently find good economics that they wouldn’t get any other way. 

- And once we get into microeconomics, we get into the concept of advantages of scale. Now we’re getting closer to investment analysis – because in terms of which business succeed and which businesses fail, advantages of scale are ungodly important. 

- For example, one great advantage of scale taught in all of the business schools of the world is cost reductions along the so-called experience curve. Just doing something complicated in more and more volume enables human beings, who are trying to improve and are motivated by the incentives of capitalism, to do it more and more efficiently.

- The very nature of things is that if you get a whole lot of volume through your operation, you get better at processing that volume. That’s an enormous advantage. And it has a lot to do with which businesses succeed and fail.

- Let’s go through a list – albeit an incomplete one – of possible advantages of scale. Some come from simple geometry. If you’re building a great circular tank, obviously, as you build it bigger, the amount of steel you use in the surface goes up with the square and the cubic volume goes up with the cube. So as you increase the dimensions, you can hold a lot more volume per unit area of steel. 

- And there are all kinds of things like that where the simple geometry – the simple reality – gives you an advantage of scale. 

- For example, you can get advantages of scale from TV advertising. … In effect, if you didn’t have a big volumne, you couldn’t use network TV advertising – which was the most effective technique. … So when TV came in, the branded companies that were already big got a huge tailwind. Indeed, they prospered and prospered and prospered until some of them got fat and foolish, which happens with prosperity – at least to some people. 

- And you advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. So, in effect, Wrigley, simply by being so well known, has advantages of scale – what you might call an informational advantage. 

- Another advantage of scale comes from psychology. The psychologists use the term “social proof.” We are all influenced – subconsciously and, to some extent, consciously – by what we see others do and approve.

- Side1: “Change, as in the case of the Internet, can be the friend of society. But it is the absence of change that is often the friend of the investor." -- Buffett

- Side2: “Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others.” – Jack Welch

- Side3: “What you measure is what you get. What you reward is what you get.” – Welch  

- Similarly, all these huge advantages of scale allow greater specialization within the firm. Therefore, each person can be better at what he does. 
 
- And these advantages of scale are so great, for example, that when Jack Welch came into GE, he just said, “To hell with it. We’re either going to be #1 or #2 in every field we’re in or we’re going to be out. I don’t care how many people I have to fire and what I have to sell. We’re going to be #1 or #2 or out.”

- That was a very tough-minded thing to do, but I think it was a very correct decision if you’re thinking about maximizing shareholder wealth. 

- And there are also disadvantages of scale. For eg, we – by which I mean BH – are the largest shareholder in Capital Cities/ABC. And we had trade publications there that got murdered – where our competitors beat us. And the way they beat us was by going to a narrower specialization. 

- So occasionally, scaling down and intensifying gives you the big advantage. Bigger is not always better. 

- The great defect of scale, of course, which makes the game interesting – so that the big people don’t always win – is that as you get big, you get the bureaucracy. And with the bureaucracy comes the territoriality – which is again grounded in human nature. 

- The constant curse of scale is that it leads to big, dumb bureaucracy – which, of course, reaches its highest and worst form in government, where the incentives are really awful.

- So life is an everlasting battle between those two forces – to get these advantages of scale on one side and a tendency to get a lot like the US Agriculture Department on the other side. 

- On the subject of advantages of economies of scale, I find chain stores quite interesting. Just think about it. The concept of a chain store was a fascinating invention. You get this huge purchasing power – which means that you have lower merchandise costs. You get a whole bunch of little laboratories out there in which you can conduct experiments. And you get specialization. 

-	He played the chain store game harder and better than anyone else. Walton invented practically nothing. But he copied everything anybody else ever did that was smart – and he did it with more fanaticism and better employee manipulation. So he just blew right by them all.  

-	He also had a very interesting competitive strategy in the early days. He was like a prize-fighter who wanted a great record so he could he in the finals and make a big TV hit. 

-	Walton, being as shrewd as he was, basically broke other small town merchants in the early days. With his more efficient system, he might not have been able to tackle some titan head-on at the time. But with his better system, he could sure as hell destroy those small town merchants. And he went around doing tit time after time after rime. Then, as he got bigger, he started destroying the big boys. 

-	Well, that was a very, very shrewd strategy. 

- You can say, “Is this a nice way to behave?” Well, capitalism is a pretty brutal place. 

- But, at any rate, it’s an interesting model of how the scale of things and fanaticism combine to be very powerful. 

- Here’s a model that we’ve had trouble with. Maybe you’ll be able to figure it out better. Many markets get down to two or three big competitors – or five or six. And in some of those markets, nobody makes any money to speak of. But in others, everybody does very well. 

- Obviously, there’s a brand identity factor in cereals that doesn’t exist in airlines. That must be the main factor that accounts for it. 

- For example, if you look around at bottler markets, you’ll find many markets where bottlers of Pepsi and Coke both make a lot of money and many others where they destroy most of the profitability of the two franchisees. That must get down to the peculiarities of individual adjustment to market capitalism. I think you’d have to know the people involved to fully understand what was happening. 

- In microeconomics, of course, you’ve got the concept of patents, trademarks, exclusive franchises, and so forth. Patents are quite interesting. 

- The great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when technology is going to help you and when it’s going to kill you. 

- And he knew that the huge productivity increases that would come from a better machine introduced into the production of a commodity product would all go to the benefit of the buyers of the textiles. Nothing was going to stick to our ribs as owners. 

- Then there’s another model from microeconomics that I find very interesting. When technology moves as fast as it does in a civilization like ours, you get a phenomenon that I call competitive destruction. 

- And when these new businesses come in, there are huge advantages for the early birds. And when you’re an early bird, there’s model that I call “surfing” – when a surfer gets up and catches the wave and just stays there, he can go a long, long time. But if he gets off the wave, he becomes mired in shallows. 

- But people get long runs when they’re right on the edge of the wave. 

- And, of course, that’s exactly what an investor should be looking for. IN a long life, you can expect to profit heavily from at least a few of those opportunities if you develop the wisdom and will to seize them. At any time, “surfing” is a very powerful model. 

- Again, that is a very, very powerful idea. Every person is going to have a circle of competence. And it’s going to be very hard to enlarge that circle. 

- That is an attainable objective, given enough discipline. And people who could never win a chess tournament or stand in center court in a respectable tennis tournament can rise quite high in life by slowly developing a circle of competence – which results partly from what they were born with and partly from what they slowly develop through work. 

- Well, so much for the basic microeconomic models, a little bit of psychology, a little bit of mathematics, helping create what I call the general substructure of worldly wisdom. 

- The first question is, “What is the nature of the stock market?” And that gets you directly to this efficient market theory that got to be the rage – a total rage – long after I graduated from law school.  

- Is the stock market so efficient that people can’t beat it? Well, the efficient market theory is obviously roughly right – meaning that markets are quite efficient and it’s quite hard for anybody to beat the market by significant margins as a stock picker by just being intelligent and working in a disciplined way. … So the answer is that it’s partly efficient and partly inefficient. … And, by the way, I have a name for people who went to the extreme efficient market theory – which is “bonkers.”

- The model I like – to sort of simplify the notion of what goes on in a market for common stocks – is the pari-mutuel system at the race track. If you stop to think about it, a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets, and the odds change based on what’s bet. That’s what happens in the stock market. 

- It’s not given to human beings to have such talent that they can just know everything about everything all the time. But it is given to human beings who work hard at it – who look and sift the world for a mispriced bet – that they can occasionally find one. 

- And the wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of the time, they don’t. It’s just that simple. 

- How many insights do you need? Well, I’d argue that you don’t need many in a lifetime. If you look at BH and all of its accumulated billions, the top ten insights account for most of it. And that’s with a very brilliant man – Warren’s a lot more able than I am and very disciplined – devoting his lifetime to it. I don’t mean to say that he’s only had ten insights. I’m just saying that most of the money came from ten insights. 

- So you can get very remarkable investment results if you think more like a winning pari-mutuel player. Just think of it as a heavy odds against game full of bullshit and craziness with an occasional mispriced something or other. And you’re probably not going to be smart enough to find thousands in a lifetime. And when you get a few, you really load up. It’s just that simple. 

- He says, “Under those rules, you’d really think carefully about what you did, and you’d be forced to load up on what you’d really thought about. So you’d do so much better.”

- Again, this is a concept that seems perfectly obvious to me. And to Warren, it seems perfectly obvious. But this is one of the very few business classes in the United States where anybody will be saying so. It just isn’t the conventional wisdom.

- To me, it’s obvious that the winner has to bet very selectively. It’s been obvious to me since very early in life. I don’t know why it’s not obvious to very many other people. 

- I think the reasons why we got into such idiocy in investment management is best illustrated by a story that I tell about the guy who sold fishing tackle. I asked him, “My God, they’re purple and green. Do fish really take these lures?” And he said, “Mister, I don’t sell to fish.”

- Investment managers are in the position of that fishing tackle salesman. They’re like the guy who was selling salt to the guy who already had too much salt. And as long as the guy will buy salt, why, they’ll sell salt. But that isn’t what ordinarily works for the buyer of investment advice. 

- So what makes sense for the investor is different from what makes sense for the manager. And, as usual in human affairs, what determines the behavior are incentives for the decision maker. 

- So getting the incentives right is a very, very important lesson. 

- All right, we’ve now recognized that the market is efficient as a pari-mutuel system is efficient with the favorite more likely than the long shot to do well in racing, but not necessarily give any betting advantage to those that bet on the favorite. 

- At any rate, the trouble with what I call the classic Ben Graham concept is that gradually the world wised up, and those real obvious bargains disappeared. You could run your Geiger counter over the rubble, and it wouldn’t work. 

- But such is the nature of people who have a hammer – to whom, as I mentioned, every problem looks like a nail – that the Ben Graham followers responded by changing the calibration on their Geiger counters. In effect, they started defining a bargain in a different way. And they kept changing the definition so that they could keep doing what they’d always done. And it still worked pretty well. So the Ben Graham intellectual system was a very good one.  

- Of course, the best part of it all was his concept of “Mr. Market.” Instead of thinking the market was efficient, Graham treated it as a manic-depressive who comes by every day. 

- This was a very significant mental construct. And it’s been very useful to Buffet, for instance, over his whole adult lifetime. 

- Limitations: For example, Graham didn’t want to ever talk to management. 

- [Most investment managers are] in a game where the clients expect them to know a lot about a lot of things. … In investment management today, everybody wants not only to win, but to have the path never diverge very much from a standard path except on the upside. Well, that is a very artificial, crazy construct. 

- And the Berkshire system is not “bonkers.” It’s so damned elementary that even bright people are going to have limited, really valuable insights in a very competitive world when they’re fighting against other very bright, hardworking people. 

- And it makes sense to load up on the very few good insights you have instead of pretending to know everything about everything at all times. You’re much more likely to do well if you start out to do something feasible instead of something that isn’t feasible. Isn’t that perfectly obvious? 

- We’ve really made the money out of high-quality business. In some cases, we bought the whole business. And in some cases, we just bought a big block of stock., But when you analyze what happened, the big money’s been made in the high-quality businesses. And most of the other people who’ve made a lot of money have done so in high-quality businesses. 

- Over the long term, it’s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. … 

- So the trick is getting into better businesses. And that involves all of these advantages of scale that you could consider momentum effects. 

- How do you get into these great companies? One method is what I’d call the method of finding them small – get’em when they’re little. For example, buy Wal-Mart when Sam Walton first goes public and so forth. And a log of people try to do just that. And it’s a very beguiling idea. If I were a young man, I might actually go into it. 

- And ideally – and we’ve done a lot of this – you get into a great business which also has a great manager because management matters. 

- So you do get an occasional opportunity to get into a wonderful business that’s being run by a wonderful manager. And, of course, that’s hog heaven day. If you don’t load up when you get those opportunities, it’s a big mistake. 

- Occasionally, you’ll find a human being who’s so talented that he can do things that ordinary skilled mortals can’t 

- These people do come along – and, in many cases, they’re not all that hard to identify. If they’ve got a reasonable hand – with the fanaticism and intelligence and so on that these people generally bring to the party – then management can matter much. 

- However, averaged out, betting on the quality of a business is better than betting on the quality of management. In other words, if you have to choose one, bet on the business momentum, not the brilliance of the manager. 

- But, very rarely, you find a manager who’s so good that you’re wise to follow him into what looks like a mediocre business. 

- Another very simple effect I very seldom see discussed either by investment managers or anybody else is the effect of taxes. 

- But in terms of business mistakes that I’ve seen over a long lifetime, I would say that trying to minimize taxes too much is one of the great standard causes of really dumb mistakes. I see terrible mistakes from people being overly motivated by tax considerations. 

- There are huge advantages for an individual to get into a position where you make a few great investments and just sit on your ass: You’re paying less to brokers. You’re listening to less nonsense. And if it works, the governmental tax system gives you an extra one, two, or three percentage points per annum compounded. 

- Thus, a large investment disaster resulted from too high prices. And you’ve got to be aware of that danger. 

- So there are risks. Nothing is automatic and easy. But if you can find some fairly priced great company and buy it and sit, that tends to work out very, very well indeed – especially for an individual. 

- Within the growth stock model, there’s a sub-position: there are actually businesses that you will find a few times in a lifetime where any manager could raise the return enormously just by raising prices – and yet they haven’t done it. So they have huge untapped pricing power that they’re not using. That is the ultimate no-brainer. 

- You will get a few opportunities to profit from finding underpricing. There are actually people out there who don’t price everything as high as the market will easily stand. And once you figure that out, it’s like finding money in the street – if you have the courage of your convictions. 

- Let me mention another model. Of course, Gillette and Coke make fairly low-priced items and have a tremendous marketing advantage all over the world. And in Gillette’s case, they keep “surfing” along new technology, which is fairly simple by the standards of microchips. But it’s hard for competitors to do. 

- GEICO is a very interesting model. It’s another one of the one hundred of so models you ought to have in your head. I’ve had many friends in the sick-business-fix game over a long lifetime. And they practically all use the following formula – I call it the cancer surgery formula: 
They look at this mess. And they figure out if there’s anything sound left that can live on its own if they cut away everything else. And if they find anything sound, they just cut away everything else. Of course, if that doesn’t work, they liquidate the business. But it frequently does work. 

- And, in GEICO’s case, think about all the money we passively made. It was a wonderful business combined with a bunch of foolishness that could easily be cut out. And people were coming in who were temperamentally and intellectually designed so they were going to cut it out. That is a model you want to look for. 

- And you may find one or two or three in a long lifetime that are very good. And you may find twenty or thirty that are good enough to be quite useful.

- Finally, I’d like to once again talk about investment management. That is a funny business – because on a net basis, the whole investment management business together gives no value added to all buyers combined. That’s the way it has to work. 

- Of course, that isn’t true of plumbing, and it isn’t true of medicine. If you’re going to make your careers in the investment management business, you face a very peculiar situation. And most investment managers handle it with psychological denial – just like a chiropractor. That is the standard method of handling the limitations of the investment management process. But if you want to live the best sort of life, I would urge each of you not to use the psychological denial model. 

- I think a select few – a small percentage of the investment managers – can deliver value added. But I don’t think brilliance alone is enough to do it. I think that you have to have a little of this discipline of calling your shorts and loading up – if you want to maximize your chances of becoming one who provides above average real returns for clients over the long pull. 

- But I’m just talking about investment managers engaged in common stock picking. I am agnostic elsewhere. I think there may well be people who are so shrewd about currencies and this, that, and the other thing that they can achieve good long-term records operating on a pretty big scale in that way. But that doesn’t happen to be my milieu. I’m talking about stock picking in American stocks. 

- I think it’s hard to provide a lot of value added to the investment management client, but it’s not impossible. 

#### Talk Two Revisited
- By investing in LBO funds, Harvard and Yale, introduced leverage into their results from owning interests in US businesses. 

- In category after category, 

- H & Y wisely and opportunistically imitated investment banking firms by going into several activities that were then on-traditional. 

- Finally, the benefits that came to H & Y in recent years through leverage and unconventionality were often, of course, given a large tailwind by a happy combination of declining interest rates and rising price-earnings ratios for stocks.

## Talk Six: Investment Practices of Learning Charitable Foundations 
#### Speech to the Foundation Finantial Officers Group at Miramar Sheraton Hotel, Santa Monica, California, October 14, 1998, sponsored by the Conrad Hilton Foundation, the Amateur Athletic Foundation, the J. Paul Getty Trust, and Rio Hondo Memorial Foundation.
