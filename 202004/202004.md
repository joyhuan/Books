## Learning Process 
The game is to keep learning. You gotta like the learning process. 

If you're going to be an investor, you're going to make some investments 
where you don't have all the experience you need. 

The keys are discipline, hard work, and practice. It's like playing golf - 
you have to work on it. 

If you don't keep learning, other people will pass you by. 

## Circle of Competence and Its Boundaries 
There are a lot of things we pass on. We have three baskets: in, out, and 
too tough. We have to have a special insight, or we'll put it in the "too
tough" basket. All you have to look for is a special area of competency and 
focus on that. 

If you have competence, you know the edge. It wouldn't be a competence if you 
didn't know where the boundaries lie. [Asking whether you've passed the boundary
is] a question that almost answers itself. 

## Cost of Capital and Opportunity Costs

## Unrealistic Assumptions 
"Abraham Lincoln once asked: 'How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail 
a leg? Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.' Likewise, just because
an actuary says you can earn 9% on pension-plan assets, it doesn't magically 
alter the reality of your future liability."

??? What does this mean? 

"A man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way."
-- Mark Twain

It is the nature of many forms of derivatives, and insurance as well, to have "long
tails" of exposure. Years can elapse before an actual day of reckoning occurs with 
respect to loss or gain on an individual transaction. Insurers or financial 
institutions that incorrectly assess their true exposure often experience the kind of
painful lesson Twain refers to above. 

## Mental Models
**The Importance of Multiple Mental Models**
You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely -- all of them,
not just a few. You know the old saying: To the man with a hammer, the world looks like
a nail. 

## The Ethos of Not Fooling Yourself
**Common (and Uncommon) Sense**
Organized common (or uncommon) sense -- very basic knowledge -- is an enormously powerful
tool. There are huge dangers with computers. People calculate too much and think too little. 

Part of [having uncommon sense] is being able to tune out folly, as opposed to recognize 
wisdom.

## Critique of Academia 
**Fatal Unconnectedness**: There's a lot wrong [with American universities]. I'd remove 
three-fourths of the faculty -- everything but the hard sciences. But nobody's going
to do that, so we'll have to live with the defects. 

I think liberal arts faculties at major universities have views that are not very sound,
at least on public policy issues. [However,] they may know a lot of French. 

## Tips on How to Be Happy and Successful
A log of success in life and business comes from knowing what you want to avoid: early
death, a bad marriage, etc. 

Just avoid things like AIDS situations, racing trains to the crossing, and doing cocaine. 
Develop good mental habits.

Avoid evil, particularly if they're attractive members of the opposite sex.

If your new behavior earns you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group, then
the hell with them. 

## Humor ???? Eludes me haha 
- I always like it when someone attractive to me agrees with me, so I have fond memories of 
Phil Fisher. 
- It is, of course, normal for self-appraisal to be more positive than external appraisal. 
Indeed, a problem of this sort may have given you your speaker today. 
- It's been so long since we've bought anything that [asking us about our market impact when 
we're trading] is like asking Rip Van Winkle about the past twenty years. 
- I think the people who are attracted to be prison guard are not nature's noblemen to begin
with. 
- Ben Franklin was a very good ambassador; and whatever was wrong with him from John Adams' 
point of view [I'm sure] helped him with the French.
