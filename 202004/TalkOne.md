# Munger
## Talk One: Harvard School Commencement Speech June 13, 1986
### Carson's prescription for sure misery included:
1. Ingesting chemicals in an effort to alter mood or perception; 

2. Envy; and 

3. Resentment 

### Four more prescriptions from Munger: 
1. Be unreliable 

2. Learn everything you possibly can from your own experience, minimizing what you learn vicariously from the good and bad experience of others, living and dead. 

3. Go down and stay down when you get your first, second, or third severe reverse in the battle of life. 

4. Ignore a story they told me when I was very young about a rustic who said, "I wish I knew where I was going to die, and then I'd never go there."

- The life of Darwin demonstrates how a turtle may outrun the hares, aided by extreme objectivity, which helps the objective person end up like the only player without a blindfold in a game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey.
