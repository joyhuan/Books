## Talk Seven Break: Breakfast Meeting of the Philanthropy Roundtable 
#### November 10, 2020 

- I am here today to talk about so-called "wealth effects" from rising prices for US common stocks. 

- The ethical rule is from Samuel Johnson, who believed that maintenance of easily removable 
ignorance by a responsible officeholder was treacherous malfeasance in meeting moral obligation. 
The prudential rule is that underlying the old Warner & Swasey advertisement for machine tools: 
“The man who needs a new machine tool and hasn’t bought it is already paying for it.” The Warner & 
Swasey rule also applies, I believe, to thinking tools. If you don’t have the right thinking tools, 
you, and the people you seek to help, are already suffering from your easily removable ignorance.
