## Talk Nine: Academic Economics: Strengths and Faults after Considering Interdisciplinary Needs 
#### Herb Kay Undergraduate Lecture UCSB Economics Department, Oct 3, 2003
1. Fatal Connectedness. Leading to Man-with-a-Hammer Syndrome, Often Causing Overweighing What Can Be Counted
2. Failure to Follow the Fundamental Full-Attribution Ethos of Hard Science 
3. Physics Envy 
4. Too Much Emphasis on Macroeconomics 
    
    Well, how did I solve those problems? Obviously, I was using a simple search engine in my mind to go through checklist-style, and I was using some rough algorithms that work pretty well in a great many complex systems, and those algorithms run something like this: Extreme success is likely to be caused by some combination of the following factors: 
      1. Extreme maximization or minimization of one or two variable. Example, Costco or our furniture and appliance store.
      2. Adding success factors so that a bigger combination drives success, often in nonlinear fashion, as one is reminded by the concept of breakpoint and the concept of critical mass in physics. Often results are not linear. You get a little bit more mass, and you get a lollapalooza result. And, of course, I've been searching for lollapalooza results all my life, so I'm very interested in models that explain their occurrence. 
      3. An extreme of good performance over many factors. Example, Toyota or Les Schwab. 
      4. Catching and riding some sort of big wave. Example, Oracle. By the way, I cited Oracle before I knew that the Oracle CFO (Jeff Henley) was a big part of the proceedings here today. 

5. Too Little Synthesis in Economics 
    
    There are four categories of answers to this problem. A few people get the first category but rarely any of the others. 

    1. Luxury goods: Raising the price can improve the product's ability as a "show-off" item, i.e., by raising the price the utility of the goods is improved to someone engaging in conspicuous consumption. Further, people will frequently assume that the high price equates to a better product, and this can sometimes lead to increased sales. 

    2. Non-luxury goods: same as second factor cited above, i.e., the higher price conveys information assumed to be correct by the consumer, that the higher price connotes higher value. This can especially apply to industrial goods where high reliability is an important factor. 

    3. Raise the price and use the extra revenue in legal ways to make the product work better or to make the sales system work better. 

    4. Raise the price and use the extra revenue in illegal or unethical ways to drive sales by the functional equivalent of bribing purchasing agents or in other ways detrimental to the end consumer, i.e., mutual fund commission practices. [This is the answer I like the most, but never get]
6. Extreme and Counterproductive Psychological Ignorance 
7. Too little Attention to Second- and Higher-Order Effects 
8. Not Enough Attention to the Concept of Febezzlement 
9. Not Enough Attention to Virtue and Vice Effects
