## Persuasion Tip 1
When you identify as part of a group, your opinions tend to be biased toward the group consensus. 

## Persuasion Tip 2 
Humans are hardwired to reciprocate favors. If you want someoneâ€™s cooperation in the future, do something for that person today. 

## Persuasion Tip 3 
Persuasion is effective even when the subject recognized the technique. Everyone knows that stores list prices at $9.99 because $10.00 sounds like too much. It still works. 

## Persuation Tip 4 
The things that you think about the most will irrationally rise in importance in your mind. 

## Persuation Tip 5 
An intentional "error" in the details of your message will attract criticism. The attention will make your message rise in importance - at least in people's minds - simply because everyone is talking about it.

## Persuation Tip 6 
If you are not a Master Persuader running for president, fin the sweet spot between apologizing too much, which signals a lack of confidence, and never apologizing for anything, which makes you look like a sociopath. 

## Persuation Tip 7 
It is easy to fit completely different explanations to the observed facts. Don't trust any interpretation of reality that isn't able to predict. 

## Persuation Tip 8 
People are more influenced by the direnction of things than the current state of things. 

## Persuation Tip 9 
Display confidence (either real of faked) to improve your persuasiveness. You have to believe yourself, or at least appear as if you do, in order to get anyone else to believe. 

## Persuation Tip 10 
Persuation is strongest when the messenger is credible. 

## Persuation Tip 11 
Guess what people are thinking - at the very moment they think it - and call it out. If you are right, the subject bonds to you for being like-minded. 

## Persuation Tip 12 
If you want the audience to embrace your content, leave out any detail that is both unimportatn and would give people a reason to think, *That's not me*. Design into your content enough black spaces so people can fill them in with whatever makes them happiest. 

## Persuation Tip 13 
Use the High-Ground Maneuver to frame yourself as the wise adult in the room. It forces others to join you or be framed as the small thinkers. 

- The grand illusion of life is that our minds have the capacity to understand reality. But human minds didn't evolve to understand reality. We didn't need that capability. A clear view of reality wasn't necessary for our survival. Evolution cares only that you survive long enough to procreate. And that's a low bar. The result is that each of us is, in effect, living in our own little movie that our brain has cooked up for us to explain our experiences. 
- Humans are 90% irrational, and 10% rational
- Remember the two important elements of filters. They should make you happy, and they should do a good job of predicting the future.
