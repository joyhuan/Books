#### Persuation Tip 8 
People are more influenced by the direnction of things than the current state of things. 

#### Persuation Tip 9 
Display confidence (either real of faked) to improve your persuasiveness. You have to believe yourself, or at least appear as if you do, in order to get anyone else to believe. 

#### Persuation Tip 10 
Persuation is strongest when the messenger is credible. 

#### Persuation Tip 11 
Guess what people are thinking - at the very moment they think it - and call it out. If you are right, the subject bonds to you for being like-minded. 

#### Persuation Tip 12 
If you want the audience to embrace your content, leave out any detail that is both unimportatn and would give people a reason to think, *That's not me*. Design into your content enough black spaces so people can fill them in with whatever makes them happiest.

#### Persuasion Tip 2 
Humans are hardwired to reciprocate favors. If you want someone’s cooperation in the future, do something for that person today. 

#### Persuasion Tip 3 
Persuasion is effective even when the subject recognized the technique. Everyone knows that stores list prices at $9.99 because $10.00 sounds like too much. It still works. 

#### Persuation Tip 4 
The things that you think about the most will irrationally rise in importance in your mind. 

#### Persuation Tip 5 
An intentional "error" in the details of your message will attract criticism. The attention will make your message rise in importance - at least in people's minds - simply because everyone is talking about it.

#### Persuation Tip 6 
If you are not a Master Persuader running for president, fin the sweet spot between apologizing too much, which signals a lack of confidence, and never apologizing for anything, which makes you look like a sociopath. 

Warning: Intentionally ignoring facts and logic in public is a dangerous strategy unless you are a Master Persuader with thick skin and an appetite for risk. Most of us don’t have the persuasion skills, risk profile, and moral flexibility to pull it off.

Success cures most types of “mistakes.”

## Part 2 How to See Reality in a More Useful Way 
### The Myth of the Rational Mind
- The grand illusion of life is that our minds have the capacity to understand reality. But human minds didn't evolve to understand reality. We didn't need that capability. A clear view of reality wasn't necessary for our survival. Evolution cares only that you survive long enough to procreate. And that's a low bar. The result is that each of us is, in effect, living in our own little movie that our brain has cooked up for us to explain our experiences. 
- Humans are 90% irrational, and 10% rational

      When you attack a person’s belief, the person under attack is more likely to harden his belief than to abandon it, even if your argument is airtight.

  - Reason 
      
      We humans like to think we are creatures of reason. We aren't. The reality is that we make our decisions first and rationalize them later. It just doesn't feel taht way to us. The exception to this rule is when there is no emotional content to a dcision and you have all the information you need.

#### SETTING THE TABLE
I learned in hypnosis class that it is easier to persuade people when they expect to be persuaded.

Credibility, of any sort, is persuasive. That’s why doctors and lawyers post their degrees on the wall where everyone can see them. That’s why high-end consultants wear expensive business suits. When you signal your credentials, people expect you to have more influence over them. That’s how we’re wired. We defer to experts almost automatically.

#### PERSUASION TIP 16 
It is easier to persuade a person who believes you are persuasive.

If you get the mood right, and your credibility is high, you’re halfway done with your persuasion before anyone knows you started.

In the context of persuasion, you don’t need a physical picture if you can make someone imagine the scene.

Participate in activities at which you excel compared with others.
