## Chapter 11 Network Programming 
### 11.1 The Client-Server Programming Model 
### 11.2 Networks 
### 11.3 The Global IP Internet 
#### 11.3.1 IP Addresses 
#### 11.3.2 Internet Domain Names 
#### 11.3.3 Internet Connections 
A connection is point-to-point in the sense that it connects a pair of processes. 

A socket is an end point of a connection. Each socket has a corresponding socket addres that consists of an Internet addres and a 16-bit integer port and is denoted by the notation address:port. 

### 11.4 The Sockets Interface 
The socket interface is a set of functions that are used in conjunction with the Unix I/O functions to build network applications. 

#### 11.4.1 Socket Address Structures 
From the perspective of the Linux kernel, a socket is an end point for communication. From the perspective of a Linux program, a socket is an open file with a corresponding descriptor. 

Internet socket addresses are stored in 16-byte structure having the type sockaddr_in, shown in Figure 11.13. 
#### 11.4.2 The socket Function 
#### 11.4.3 The connect Function 
#### 11.4.4 The bind Function 
#### 11.4.5 The listen Function 

#### 11.4.6 The accept Function 
#### 11.4.7 Host and Service Conversion
