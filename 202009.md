# Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
> In about 1951, a quality approach called Total Productive Maintenance(TPM) came on the Japanesse scene. Its focus is on maintenance rather than on production. One of the major pillars of TPM is the set of so-called 5S principles. 

> Seiri, or organization (think "sort" in English). Knowing where things are -- using approaches such as suitable naming -- is crucial.

> Seiton, or tidiness (think "systematize" in English). There is an old American saying: *A place for everything, and everything in its place.* A piece of code should be where you expect to find it -- and, if not, you should re-factor to get it htere. 

> Seiso, or cleaning (think "shine" in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging wires, grease, scraps, and waster. What do the authors here say about littering you code with comments and commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for the future? Get rid of them. 

> Seiketsu, or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean. Do you think this book says anythin about having a consistent coding style and set of practices within the group? Where do those standards come from? Read on. 

> Shutsuke, or discipline (self-discipline). This means having the discipline to follow the practices and to frequently reflect on one's work and be willing to change.

> As we maintain automobiles and other machines under TPM, breaking-down maintenance -- waiting for bugs to surface -- is the exception. Instead, we go up a level: inspect the machiens every day and fix wearing parts before they break, or do the equivalent of the proverbial 10,000-mile oil change to forestall wear and tear. 

> In code, refactor mercilessly. You can improve yet one level further, as the TMP movement innovated over 50 years ago: build machines that are more maintainable in the first place. Making your code readable is as important as making it executable.
