# Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
> In about 1951, a quality approach called Total Productive Maintenance(TPM) came on the Japanesse scene. Its focus is on maintenance rather than on production. One of the major pillars of TPM is the set of so-called 5S principles. 

> Seiri, or organization (think "sort" in English). Knowing where things are -- using approaches such as suitable naming -- is crucial.

> Seiton, or tidiness (think "systematize" in English). There is an old American saying: *A place for everything, and everything in its place.* A piece of code should be where you expect to find it -- and, if not, you should re-factor to get it htere. 

> Seiso, or cleaning (think "shine" in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging wires, grease, scraps, and waster. What do the authors here say about littering you code with comments and commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for the future? Get rid of them. 

> Seiketsu, or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean. Do you think this book says anythin about having a consistent coding style and set of practices within the group? Where do those standards come from? Read on. 

> Shutsuke, or discipline (self-discipline). This means having the discipline to follow the practices and to frequently reflect on one's work and be willing to change.

> As we maintain automobiles and other machines under TPM, breaking-down maintenance -- waiting for bugs to surface -- is the exception. Instead, we go up a level: inspect the machiens every day and fix wearing parts before they break, or do the equivalent of the proverbial 10,000-mile oil change to forestall wear and tear. 

> In code, refactor mercilessly. You can improve yet one level further, as the TMP movement innovated over 50 years ago: build machines that are more maintainable in the first place. Making your code readable is as important as making it executable.

## Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structure 
### Data Abstraction 
### Data/Object Anti-Symmetry 
- Complimentary natures of theses two definitions; They are virtual opposites! 
- Objects expose behavior and hide data. This makes it easy to add new kinds of objects without changing existing behaviors. It also makes it hard to add new behaviors to existing objects. 
- Data structures expose data and have no significant behavior. This makes it easy to add new behaviors to existing data structures but makes it hard to add new data structures to existing functions. 
- the idea that everything is an object is a myth. Sometimes you really do want simple data structures with procedures operatin g on them. 
### The Law of Demeter 
- Methods should NOT invoke methods on objects that are returned by any of the allowed functions. 
- Talk to frinds, not to strangers. 
#### Train Wrecks 
#### Hybrids 
- Doom of hybrids: it's hard to add new functions and hard to add new data structures. Worst of both worlds. AVOID! 
#### Hiding Structure 
### Data Transfer Objects 
#### Active Record

## Chapter 9: Unit Tests 
### The Three Laws of TDD
- First Law: You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test. 
- Second Law: You may not write mroe of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing. 
- Third Law: You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test. 
### Keeping Tests Clean 
#### Tests Enable the -ilities 
### Clean Tests 
Readability 

The BUILD-OPERATE-CHECK pattern 
#### Domain-Specific Testing Language 
- Build up a set of functions and utilities that make use of those APIs and that make the tests more convenient to write and easier to read. 
- This testing API is not designed up front; rather it evolves from the continues refactoring of test code that has gotten too tainted by obfuscating detail. 
#### A Dual Standard 
### One Assert per Test 
#### Single Concept per Test 
### F.I.R.S.T.
