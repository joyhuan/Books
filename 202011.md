## PART 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle 
- Credit if the giving of buying power. This buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay 
it back, which is debt.
### How I Think about Credit and Debt
### The Template for the Archetypal Long-Term/Big Debt Cycle 
Since there was about a 75 percent correlation between the amounts of their foreign debts and the amounts of inflation that they experienced (which is not surprising, since having a lot of their debts denominated in foreign currency was a cause of their depressions being inflationary), it made sense to group those that had more foreign currency debt with those that had inflationary depressions.

### The Phases of the Classical Deflationary Debt Cycle 
#### Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises
If the write-down is 30 percent, then the creditor’s assets are reduced by that much. If that sounds like a lot, it’s actually much more. Since most lenders are leveraged (e.g., they
borrow to buy assets), the impact of a 30 percent write-down on their net worth can be much greater. For example, the creditor who is leveraged 2:1 would experience a 60 percent decline in his net worth (i.e., their assets are twice their net worth, so the decline in asset value has twice the impact).7 Since banks are typically leveraged about 12:1 or 15:1, that picture is obviously devastating for them and for the economy as a whole.
