## PART 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle 
### How I Think about Credit and Debt
Credit is the giving of buying power. This buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back, which is debt.

The downside risks of having a significant amount of debt depends a lot on the willingness and the ability of policy makers to spread out the losses arising from bad debts. Whether policy makers can do this depends on two factors: 1. Whether the debt is denominated in the currency that they control and 2. whether they have influence over how creditors and debtors behave with each other.

Two main long-term problems that emerge from these kinds of debt cycles are:
1. The losses arising from the expected debt service payments not being made.
2. The reduction of lending and the spending it was financing going forward.

From my examination of these caes, the biggest risks are not from the debts themselves but from a. the failure of policy makers to do the right things, due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority, and b. the political consequences of making adjustments that hurt some people in the process of helping others. 

There are four types of levers that policy makers can pull to bring debt and debt service levels down relative to the income and cash flow levels that are required to service them:
1. Austerity (i.e., spending less)
2. Debt defaults/restructurings
3. The central bank "printing money" and making purchases (or providing guarantees)
4. Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less

The key to creating a "beautiful deleveraging" (a reduction in debt/income ratios accompanied by acceptable inflation and growth rates) lies in striking the right balance betweeen them.

### The Template for the Archetypal Long-Term/Big Debt Cycle

For clarity, I divided the affected countries into two groups:
1. Those that didn't have much of their debt denominated in foreign currency and that didn't experience inflationary depressions, and 
2. those that had a significant amount of their debt denominated in foreign currency and did experience inflationary depressions.
Since there was about a 75% correlation between the amounts of their foreign debts and the amounts of inflation that they experienced (which is not surprising, since having a lot of their debts denominated in foreign currency was a cause of their depressions being inflationary), it made sense to group those that had more foreign currency debt with those that had inflationary depressions.

### Our Examination of the Cycle 

Money serves two purposes: it is a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth. And because it has two purposes, it serves two masters: 1. those who want to obtain it for "life's necessities," usually by working for it, and 2. those who have stored wealth tied to its value.

#### deflationary and inflationary depressions
- In deflationary depressions, policy makers respond to the initial economic contraction by lowering interest rates. It typically occur in countries where most of the unsustainable debt was financed domestically in local currency, so that the eventual debt bust produces forced selling and defaults, but not a currency or a balance of payments problem.
- Inflationary depressions clasically occur in countries that are reliant on foreign capital flows and so have built up a significant amount of debt denominated in foreign currency that can't be monetized (i.e., bought by money printed by the central bank).

### The Phases of the Classical Deflationary Debt Cycle

1. The Early Part of the Cycle
2. The Bubble
Eventually the debt service pyaments become equal to or larger than the amount debtors can borrow, and the debts (i.e., the promises to deliver money) become too large in relation to the amount of money in existence there is to give. When promises to deliver money (i.e., debt) can't rise any more relative to the money and credit coming in, the process works in reverse and deleveraging begins.
- The Start of a Bubble: The Bull Market
Bubbles usually start as over-extrapolations of justified bull markets.
- The Role of Monetary Policy
The lenders and the speculators make a lot of fast, easy money, which reinforces the bubble by increasing the speculators' equity, giving them the collateral they need to secure new loans.

During such times, most people think the assets are a fabulous treasure to own -- and consider anyone who doesn't own them to be missing out. As a result of this dynamic, all sorts of entities build up long positions. Large asset-liability mismatches increase in the forms of a. borrowing short-term to lend long-term, 2. taking on liquid liabilities to invest in illiquid assets, and 3. investing in riskier debt or other risky assets with money borrowed from others, and/or 4. borrowing in one currency and lending in another, all to pick up a perceived spread.

- Spotting Bubbles
To identify a big debt crisis before it occurs, I look at all the big markets and see which, if any, are in bubbles. Then I look at what's connected to them that would be affected when they pop. The most defining characteristics of bubbles that can be measured are:
    1. Prices are high relative to traditional measures
    2. Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these high levels
    3. There is broad bullish sentiment
    4. Purchases are being financed by high leverage
    5. Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases (e.g., built inventory, contracted for supplies, etc.) to speculate or to protect themselves against future price gains
    6. New buyers (i.e., those who weren't previously in the market) have entered the market
    7. Stimulative monetary policy threatens to inflate the bubble even more (and tight policy to cause its popping)

3. The Top
This reflects a general principle: When things are so good that they can't get better -- yet everyone believes that they will get better -- tops of markets are being made.
#### Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises
If the write-down is 30 percent, then the creditor’s assets are reduced by that much. If that sounds like a lot, it’s actually much more. Since most lenders are leveraged (e.g., they
borrow to buy assets), the impact of a 30 percent write-down on their net worth can be much greater. For example, the creditor who is leveraged 2:1 would experience a 60 percent decline in his net worth (i.e., their assets are twice their net worth, so the decline in asset value has twice the impact).7 Since banks are typically leveraged about 12:1 or 15:1, that picture is obviously devastating for them and for the economy as a whole.
