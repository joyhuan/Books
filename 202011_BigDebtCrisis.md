## PART 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle 
### How I Think about Credit and Debt
Credit is the giving of buying power. This buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back, which is debt.

The downside risks of having a significant amount of debt depends a lot on the willingness and the ability of policy makers to spread out the losses arising from bad debts. Whether policy makers can do this depends on two factors: 1. Whether the debt is denominated in the currency that they control and 2. whether they have influence over how creditors and debtors behave with each other.

Two main long-term problems that emerge from these kinds of debt cycles are:
1. The losses arising from the expected debt service payments not being made.
2. The reduction of lending and the spending it was financing going forward.

From my examination of these caes, the biggest risks are not from the debts themselves but from a. the failure of policy makers to do the right things, due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority, and b. the political consequences of making adjustments that hurt some people in the process of helping others. 

There are four types of levers that policy makers can pull to bring debt and debt service levels down relative to the income and cash flow levels that are required to service them:
1. Austerity (i.e., spending less)
2. Debt defaults/restructurings
3. The central bank "printing money" and making purchases (or providing guarantees)
4. Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less

The key to creating a "beautiful deleveraging" (a reduction in debt/income ratios accompanied by acceptable inflation and growth rates) lies in striking the right balance betweeen them.

### The Template for the Archetypal Long-Term/Big Debt Cycle
For clarity, I divided the affected countries into two groups:
1. Those that didn't have much of their debt denominated in foreign currency and that didn't experience inflationary depressions, and 
2. those that had a significant amount of their debt denominated in foreign currency and did experience inflationary depressions.
Since there was about a 75% correlation between the amounts of their foreign debts and the amounts of inflation that they experienced (which is not surprising, since having a lot of their debts denominated in foreign currency was a cause of their depressions being inflationary), it made sense to group those that had more foreign currency debt with those that had inflationary depressions.
### Our Examination of the Cycle 
### The Phases of the Classical Deflationary Debt Cycle 
#### Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises
If the write-down is 30 percent, then the creditor’s assets are reduced by that much. If that sounds like a lot, it’s actually much more. Since most lenders are leveraged (e.g., they
borrow to buy assets), the impact of a 30 percent write-down on their net worth can be much greater. For example, the creditor who is leveraged 2:1 would experience a 60 percent decline in his net worth (i.e., their assets are twice their net worth, so the decline in asset value has twice the impact).7 Since banks are typically leveraged about 12:1 or 15:1, that picture is obviously devastating for them and for the economy as a whole.
