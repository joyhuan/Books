# Hero of the Empire 

I got this book recommandation from an MD during a GS talk on July 23 2019. He listed the book under "Truth Stranger than Friction." At first I was amused by his smart playfulness with the words. After finishing the book, I have to say what an accurate classification!

Although he was still a very young man, Churchill was no stranger to situations of great personal peril. He had already taken part in four wars on three different continents, and had come close to death in each one.

Beyond the vaguest of outlines, he didn’t even have a plan—just the unshakable conviction that he was destined for greatness.

Churchill knew that the surest and quickest route to recognition, success and perhaps, if he was lucky, fame was a military medal.

For that, he was willing to risk anything, even his life.
