# Rental Property Investing
4 sources: Appreciation, cash flow, tax savings, and loan paydown

Break even on cash flow or lose money on cash flow, and you are on a path to finnacial ruin. I'll repeat myself one last time: Buy rental properties that offer cash flow today.

The keywords there are "consistent action" and "long period of time."
## Adhere to certain standards for the plan to work
- It must be a multifamily property (in this plan, we'll be buying fourplexes and 24-unit apartments).
- It must achieve cash flows of $200 per unit, per month after all expenses have been paid, including vacancy, maintenance, utilities, management, capital expendiures, taxes, and insurance, plus any other expenses the property may have.
- The property must be purchasable for a discount because you are great at finding deals in the market. 
- The property's value must be capable of being improved by 10 percent during the first year through "forced appreciation" (such as a paint job and landscaping).
- The property must appreciate at 3 percent per year after year one.

## Math
- Income: Fair market rent is determined by the market and what the local average is for certain characteristics of the property, such as 
    - Location of the property
    - Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
    - Amenities such as air conditioning, parking, and applicances
    - Size of the property
- Expenses: (The low margins of profit to be made on rental properties can easily be cannibalized by unexpected expenses. Therefore, having a firm grasp on what those expenses might be is vital to your success.)
    - Taxes
    - Insurances
    - Flood insurance (if needed)
    - Vacancy
    - Repairs
    - Capital expenditures
    - Water

## Chapter 12 Real Estate Negotiation
"In business as in life, you don't get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate." -- Chester L. Karrass

Negociation is the art of staying steady in a turbulent situation. It's about making minor adjustments to the left, to the right, backward, and forward. It's about keeping calm when hope seems lost. It's about successfully handling the unforseen circumstances that hit you right in the face. 

Although you may never safely crash-land an airliner onto the Hudson River, I believe that you have -- that every person has -- the skills to become a great negociator. All you need are "small, regular deposits into the bank of experience, education, and training."

## Chapter 13 Financing Your Rental Property
### All Cash
### Conventional Loans
A lender creates a mortgage for you => they will sell the loan. 
Primary job of most lenders: issue a bunch of mortgages => package them together => sell the load package so the lenders get their money back. 

The most likely buyer of these loan packages are the two government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nicknames given to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, or Freddie Mac). 

The purpose of these huge pesudo government institutions is to buy up mortgages from lenders so the lenders can get their money back and can re-loan again.
