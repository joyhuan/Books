# Rental Property Investing
## Adhere to certain standards for the plan to work
- It must be a multifamily property (in this plan, we'll be buying fourplexes and 24-unit apartments).
- It must achieve cash flows of $200 per unit, per month after all expenses have been paid, including vacancy, maintenance, utilities, management, capital expendiures, taxes, and insurance, plus any other expenses the property may have. 
- The property must be purchasable for a discount because you are great at finding deals in the market. 
- The property's value must be capable of being improved by 10 percent during the first year through "forced appreciation" (such as a paint job and landscaping).
- The property must appreciate at 3 percent per year after year one.
