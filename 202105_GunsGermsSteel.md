## Prologue Yali's Question
The book’s emphasis is on the search for ultimate explanations, and on pushing back the chain of historical causation as far as possible.

Thus, we can finally rephrase the question about the modern world’s inequalities as follows: why did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents? Those disparate rates constitute history’s broadest pattern and my book’s subject.

A domesticated animal is defined as an animal selectively bred in captivity and thereby modified from its wild ancestors, for use by humans who control the animal's breeding and food supply.

That is, domestication involved wild animals' being transformed into something more useful to humans.

Over a century ago, the British scientist Francis Galton summarized this discrepancy succinctly: “It would appear that every wild animal has had its chance of being domesticated, that [a] few . . . were domesticated long ago, but that the large remainder, who failed sometimes in only one small particular, are destined to perpetual wildness.”

### Chapter 11. Lethal Gift of Livestock 
The first stage is illustrated by dozens of disease that we now and then pick up directly from our pets and domestic animals. 

In the second stage a former animal pthogen evolves to the point where it does get transmitted directly between people and causes epidemics. However, the epidemic dies out for any of several reasons, such as being cured by modern medicine, or being stopped when everybody around has already been infected and either becomes immune or dies. 

A third stage in the evolution of our major diseases is represented by former animal pathogens that did establish themselves in humans, that have not (not yet?) died out, and that may or may not still become major killers of humanity. 

The final stage of this evolution is represented by the major, long-established epidemic diseases confined to humans.

### Chapter 12. Blueprints and Borrowed Letters 
Such transmission of inventions assumes a whole spectrum of forms. At the one end lies “blueprint copying,” when you copy or modify an available detailed blueprint. At the opposite end lies “idea diffusion,” when you receive little more than the basic idea and have to reinvent the details. Knowing that it can be done stimulates you to try to do it yourself, but your eventual specific solution may or may not resemble that of the first inventor. 

When societies do adopt a new technology from the society that invented it, the diffusion may occur in many different contexts. They include peaceful trade (as in the spread of transistors from the United States to Japan in 1954), espionage (the smuggling of silkworms from Southeast Asia to the Mideast in A.D. 552), emigration (the spread of French glass and clothing manufacturing techniques over Europe by the 200,000 Huguenots expelled from France in 1685), and war.

ones. In reality, technologies must be not only acquired but also maintained, and that too depends on many unpredictable factors.


### Chapter 13. Necessity's Mother 

When a widely useful invention does crop up in one society, it then tends to spread in either of two ways. One way is that other societies see or learn of the invention, are receptive to it, and adopt it. The second is that societies lacking the invention find themselves at a disadvantage vis-à-vis the inventing society, and they become overwhelmed and replaced if the disadvantage is sufficiently great.
### Chapter 14. From Egalitarianism to Kleptocracy
What seems to me to point to a fundamentally correct view of state formation is an undoubted fact of much wider validity than the correlation between irrigation and the formation of some states—namely, that the size of the regional population is the strongest single predictor of societal complexity.

food production contributes in at least three ways to specific features of complex societies. 
- First, it involves seasonally pulsed inputs of labor.
- Second, food production may be organized so as to generate stored food surpluses, which permit economic specialization and social stratification.

How can we account for the empirical observation that band or tribal organization just does not work for societies of hundreds of thousands of people, and that all existing large societies have complex centralized organization?

- One reason is the problem of conflict between unrelated strangers.
- A second reason is the growing impossibility of communal decision making with increasing population size. 
- A third reason involves economic considerations. Any society requires means to transfer goods between its members.
Large societies can function economically only if they have a redistributive economy in addition to a reciprocal economy.
- A final consideration mandating complex organization for large societies has to do with population densities.
