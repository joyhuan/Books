# Books
At age 22, I set myself three goals 
- push some codes for myself(not for work) each day
- go the gym each week
- read a book each month 

The first two are easy to track and see the progress. For the third goal, it's less obvious. But I still want to quantify it and I came up with two ways 
- start this Books repo
- start writing novels which reflect my thoughts gained from the books 

It's set to be private at the start. Not sure if I will ever make this public. Let's see if I can fulfill my 22-year-old goal.
