# Books
At age 22, I set myself the goal - push some codes for myself(not for work) each day; go the gym each week; and read a book each month. 

The previous two are rather easy to track and see the progress. For the third goal, it's less obvious. But I still want to quantify it and I came up with two ways -- one is to start this Books repo; the other is to start writing novels which reflect my thoughts gained from the books and experiences I had. 

It's set to be private at the start. Not sure if I will ever make this public. Let's see if I can fulfill my 22-year-old goal.
